# Exchange

This mod adds a mechanism to inject currency into a server economy, as an alternative to the universal-basic-income feature of the currency mod. It is an interesting idea of jonadab (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=4345&p=398541#p398541).

I recommend to deactivate income mechanism (in currency) and interest mechanism (in atm, if loaded).

The mod adds a ``Trade counter'' node that allows to obtain minegeld from glooptest mod "rare" metals.
